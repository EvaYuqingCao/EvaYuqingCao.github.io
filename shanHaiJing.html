								<h1>Shan Hai Jing 山海经</h1>
								<p>Virtual Reality installation: The Classic of Mountains and Seas 
									is situated between mythology and reality, documenting the geographical 
									and cultural aspects of pre-Qin China, while imagining a great variety 
									of creatures that’s like a Chinese version of Ovid’s Metamorphosis. The 
									project uses Tilt Brush to recreate these mythological creatures that 
									also live in a virtual realm. Technology makes the translation process 
									intuitive. The software Tilt Brush documents the drawing process, while 
									the flow of time could be visualized and crystalized as the drawing 
									process is replayed. This installation opens up wonderful possibilities 
									of visually translating literature that holds great artistic and social 
									potentials: Abstract but amazing models such as Borge’s El Aleph, Dante’s 
									Inferno could be visualized. For educational purposes, such projects 
									could promote the learning processes for students and especially those 
									who are affected by reading disabilities.
