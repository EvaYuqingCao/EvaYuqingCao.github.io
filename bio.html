				<h1>Eva Yuqing Cao</h1>
				<p>Eva Yuqing Cao is a multimedia storyteller, comparatist and activist 
					whose work crosses the border of the quantitative and the qualitative – 
					converging art, literature, linguistics and pressing social issues with 
					computer-science oriented technologies. Eva’s creativity combined with 
					technological skills (Python, VR/AR, Html/Css/JavaScript, C++ for Unreal 
					Engine, Adobe Creative Suite, Flixel, Corel VideoStudio) leads to her 
					aspiration of designing connective media projects that could narrate human 
					experiences and emotions ---technologies that encounter and solve human 
					problems. With the experience of interviewing migrant workers in New Delhi 
					and Beijing, the homeless in the Jungle (Ithaca’s tent city) during Covid 
					and sexual assault survivors, Eva believes in the power of the human voice 
					and storytelling. A “super-literature” is required, an avant-garde form of 
					literature that’s close to connective media that uses technology to spread 
					and amplify the human voice.
