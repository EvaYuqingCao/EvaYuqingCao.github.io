				<h1>Eva Yuqing Cao</h1>
			<p>Eva Yuqing Cao is a multimedia storyteller, comparatist, and activist
				whose work crosses the border of the quantitative and the qualitative,
				converging art, literature linguistics and pressing social issues with
				computer-science oriented technologies. Her creativity in art and
				literature as well as technological skills (Python, VR/AR,
				Html/Css/JavaScript, C++ for Unreal Engine, Adobe Creative Suite,
				Flixel, Corel VideoStudio) leads to the goal of designing connective
				media devices, apps and even startups that could narrate human
				experiences and emotions ---technologies that encounter and solve
				human problems. With the experience of interviewing reporting the
				stories of migrant workers in New Delhi, the homeless in the Jungle
				(Ithaca’s tent city) during Covid and sexual assault survivors, Eva
				believes in the power of the human voice and storytelling. A
				“super-literature” is required, an avant-garde form of literature
				that’s close to connective media that uses technology to spread and
				amplify the human voice.</p>
			<p>With the academic background in comparative literature and German
				studies (BA Cornell University 2020. PhD Northwestern University)
				and consistent, passionate endeavors in visual arts and creative
				writing, Eva’s research on Trauma, Humanism and Posthumanism,
				Linguistics and translation, Philosophies of systems and paradigms
				have provided her the foundation to work on human-oriented
				technologies.</p>
